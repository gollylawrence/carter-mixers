      Inspection, Maintenance Service & Emergency Breakdown Repairs In addition to emergency support
      Carter can reduce the incidence of such emergencies with our regular service inspection of
      your plant. The inspection visits are available as a one off service or on a regular planned
      basis. Your peace of mind is increased knowing independent specialists are inspecting and
      advising of impending problems on your mixing machinery, giving you adequate time to order
      spares and service to be completed when it suits your production needs. Any type of emergency
      repair is undertaken by our specialist team of fitters and welders. The on-site dismantling
      and rebuilding team are supported by our fully equipped machine shop and welding centre where,
      for example, hard surfacing can be repaired or replaced.
