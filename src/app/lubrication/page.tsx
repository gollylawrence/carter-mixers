      Lubrication Systems Oil Lubrication Systems The Carter variable control Dust Stop Lubrication
      System allows for adjustable process oil control. A 2 kW AC variable frequency motor and pump
      control the process oil and lube oil to the seals. The system can be slaved to the Mixer drive
      motor, which in turn will follow the rotor speed, i.e. the slower the rotor speed the less oil
      is delivered. The system includes motors, pumps, control enclosure and high-pressure switches
      all mounted on a steel panel. From the pump the oil is passed to the machine via two pipes and
      is fed to the seals through a positive feed distribution block ensuring that full pressure is
      available at each feed position. The system is fitted with relief valves and the distribution
      blocks have alarm switches to indicate any stoppage in the lubricant feed.
